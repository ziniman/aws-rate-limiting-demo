## Installation instructions

  - Go to [/serverless](https://github.com/ziniman/aws-session-feedback/tree/master/serverless) folder.
  - Deploy your serverless backend with ```sls deploy``` from the serverless folder
- For your frontend:
  - Set a new Amazon Amplify Console app in your account and point it to your repo.
